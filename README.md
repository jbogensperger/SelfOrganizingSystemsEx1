Self Oranizing Systems Exercise 1

The folders TSP and "XXXXX" TODO INSERT FOLDER NAME
each contain a python project which demonstrate the behaviour and performance of Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Ant Colony OptimizationA(ACO) on the given Problems.


TSP:
The main.py scripts can be executed without any further parameter.

The Lists in the beginning of the main script can be altered in order to execute various Problemsizes and set the number of GA-Iterations:
Please keep in mind the the elements of numberGenerations are mapped to the same index of problemsizeList

numberGenerations = [20, 275]
problemSizeList = [15, 30]
This exemplary set-up will cause that ACO and GA are executed for TSP problems with 15 and 30 cities. The GA optimization will be run for the 15 cities problem with 20 iterations and for 30 cities with 275 iterations..




GRAPH COLOURING:

TODO EXPLAIN how to execute this shit.
